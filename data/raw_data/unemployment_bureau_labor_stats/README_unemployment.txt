This folder contains a data on the unemployment rate for every county in Texas in June 2017.
The website gives a table with county name and unemployment rate
I then copied that information into an excel file: "unemp_bls_tx_jun2017.xlsx"

I then matched the county name with the FIPS code and created the csv file with unemployment, county name, and FIP:
"unemp_bls_tx_jun2017_full.csv"

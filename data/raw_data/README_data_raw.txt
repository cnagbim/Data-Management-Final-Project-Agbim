< TX_county_percentage_pov_agbim.csv>

This data set is a csv file from the U.S. census Bureau. It describes the percentage of people living in poverty in 
different counties of the U.S. in 2017. I modified the data to only contain Texas data. 
There are three columns. “CountyID” which is the unique FIP code; its data type is integer. 
“CountyID” serves as the primary key here again. “AllAgesPovertyPercent” is the percentage of people living in poverty; 
its datatype is float. “CountyNames” is the name of the county; its data type is object.

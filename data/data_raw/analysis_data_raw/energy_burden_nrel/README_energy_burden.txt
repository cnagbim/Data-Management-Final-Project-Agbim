NREL Energy Affordability and Access in Focus. Accessed Apr 12, 2019

The data was only able to query 100 counties at a time.
Therefore I had to query 3 times in order to get all 254 couties of TX.

This is how the website descibes energy burden: 

LMI Energy Burden, County Level

Description: The energy burden layer displays energy burden, or % of income spent on housing energy bills, 
at the county level for LMI households, where LMI is defined as 0-80% of Area Median Income (AMI).

Source: Energy burden is calculated using the County-level Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) dataset
for electricity, natural gas, and other fuel expenditures.

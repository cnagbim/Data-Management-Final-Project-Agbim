Final Project for Data Management Spring 2019

This final project is a study of energy burden(spending more than 2x median on household energy expenditures)in the state of Texas.
Using county level statistics we are analyzing what the indicators are for energy burden. 
We are specifically interested in socio demographic, food insecurity and health, and economic indicators/variables.
We are also interested in whether there are geographic regions (e.g. south texas) where energy burden is paricularly high.
